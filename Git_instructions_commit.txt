Git instructions (commit)
  1. bash cmd: git add . (the "." is shorthand for the 'current directory')
      - this adds all changes that are in the current directory.
      - these changes are not yet current, git hasn't actually added them yet.
  2. bash cmd: git commit -m "Initial commit" (the "-m" is short for 'message')
      - takes all the things that we've added and tells git to actually commit
      them and track them forever.
  3. read / examine the commit.
