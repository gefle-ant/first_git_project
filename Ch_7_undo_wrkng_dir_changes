Git Essentials: CH_7 Undo changes.

CH 7: Undo working directory changes.

  - A change to a file has been made in error and cannot be undone (saved).

    - Use git to restore the changes, when "git status" is checked, the user is prompted to use cmd: "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard the changes in the working dir.
    - the bare double dash " -- " in cmd: "git checkout -- <file>..." is used to checkout a file in the 'current branch'.
    - powerful, will remove any changes that are there.
    - cmd: "git checout" is a flexible comand, especially helpful when working with branches.
