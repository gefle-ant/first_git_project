Move and Rename Files

1st Example: UI
  - in this example, we are changing a file name in the folder itself via the UI, in Windows. if you change a file in the UI or folder, the even is recorded as two separate events. 1. File deletion (cmd: "git status") and 2. Untracked file

  - next, cmd: "add <file>" and cmd: "git rm <old_file>"
  - git shows "renamed: <old_file> -> <file>"
  - git realizes that more than 50% of this file is similar and that "oh!" the file name is what changed. as soon as we put file into staging

-NOTE: moving a file a renaming a file are the same thing, same file different path

2nd Example: cmd line
  - "move" as the way to rename.
    - cmd: "git mv <second_file.txt secondary_file.txt>"
  - file has been "moved" and is now renamed to secondary_file in the operating sys.
  - more efficient to do this with a single cmd.

Next Example: Create folder "first_folder" and move and existing file "third_file.txt" into it with the UI/Operating sys.
  - again git shows 1. deleted: third_file.txt and 2. Untracked first_folder
  - now, we remove the file from the folder and replace it in the main directory it was previously in.
  -next, we will try to move it with cmd: "git mv third_file.txt first_folder/third_file.txt"
