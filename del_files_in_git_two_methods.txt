Delete files. - tracking files with git when they are deleted.

  - There are 2 different techniques to delete files with git (mentioned in the course "Git Essential Training: The Basics")

    1. just delete the file yourself. Drag file to the trash or to another dir (e.g. desktop).
      - cmd: "git rm <file>" - this will remove the file and put it back in the staging area for deletion.
      - next, commit the change by using the commit cmd: "git commit -m="file deletion <file>"
        -NOTE afer typing "git rm", typing the beginning of the fiel name that you are intending to delete, e.g. "file_" and then hitting the "tab key", autocompletes the file name or name of files that are similiar, giving you the option to input the remainder of the correct file.

    2. we can tell git to remove the file in BASH.
      - cmd: "git rm <file>" file is removed using a unix remove cmd. permanently removed.
      - still exists in the repository.
      - added to Staging Directory.
      - commit change cmd: "git commit -m="<file>"
