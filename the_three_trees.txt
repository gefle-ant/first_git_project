The Three Tree Arch:

 Typical 2 Tree Arch:
    -Repository and Working
    -Checkout copy from Repository
    -Make changes and return/commit changes to the Repository.
    -If you have not checked out a copy recently and other developers have made changes to the file than the working file would not have these changes. Your working on old versions.

  Git, Three Tree Arch:
    -Still has the Repository and the Working copy, but in between is another tree know as the "Staging Index"
    -when we commit/BASH we are first adding our git add file.txt to the Staging Index, the comitting the file git commit file.txt to the Repository
    - It is possible to skip the Staging Index, though this is part of the git Arch.
    -Possible to pull "check them out" of the Repository in the same order, via the Staging Index. Usually not what we will do.
    -Three Trees:
      - Repository
        -What is being tracked by Git, the changes that it has and will keep track of.
      -Staging Index
        -Contains changes that we are about to commit to Repository
      -Working
        -Contains changes that may not be tracked by git yet.
