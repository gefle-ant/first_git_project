Hash Values (SHA-1) (unique ID# git assigns to files and their versions)
  -Git generates a checksum for each change set
  -Checksum algorithms convert data into a simple number
  -Same data always equals same Checksum
  -Data integrity is fundamental
  -Changing data would change the Checksum
  -Git uses SHA-q hash algorithm to create checksum.
    -important to know this term "Sha" value, because people refer to this when they are referring to the checksum value.
  -40 character hexadecimal string (0-9, a-f)
  -Example: 5c15e8bd540c113cd2d9eac6f64cacbc5ff6fe9c
  -git commit compares SHA-1 value and the metadata to the change
  -chain of data integrity, everything is linked to the history and relation to one another.
