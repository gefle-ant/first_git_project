View changes with diff.

  - cmd: "git diff" compares changes to a file and displays them in BASH, including add's and subt's to the file, what specificallz was changes (txt), removed added or changed.
    - will display only the changes and where they are in the file.
    - also displays each file that has uncommited changes.
    - zooms in on the change.

View only the Staged Changes using cmd: "git diff"

  - cmd: "git diff" - by default, compares the working directory against the staging Tree/Area.

  - cmd: "git diff --staged" - used if you want to see only changes made to files in the staging area.

  - "staged" is an alias for "cached"
    - cmd: "git diff --cahced" does the exact same thing as "git diff --staged"
    - before git ver 1.7, cahced was the only cmd available to compare these changes. staged was added as an alias (more intuitive and convenient)
