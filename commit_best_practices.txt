commit message best practices

    - short single line summary, less 50 char.
    - for longer description, follow initial description with
    a "blank" line, followed by a more complete description.
    - keep each line less than 72 char.
    - write in present tense "fix for a bug" or "fixes a bug"
    - bullet points are usually asterisks or hyphens
    - can add "tracking numbers" or support requests
    - can develop shorthand for your Org. "[css,js]", "bugfix:", "#66601"
    - be clear and descriptive
      - Bad: "fix typo"
      - Good: "Add missing hyphen in project section of HTML"
      - Bad: "Update login code"
      - Good "Change user authentication to use Blowfish"
    - don't add unnecessary information

    E.G.

      ghi2334 - Fixes bug in admin logout

      When an admin logged out of the admin area, they
      could not login to the members area because their
      session[:user_id] was still set to the admin ID.
      This patch fixes the bug by setting session[:user_id]
      to nil when any user logs out of any area.
