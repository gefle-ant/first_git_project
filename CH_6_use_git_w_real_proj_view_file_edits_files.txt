CH 6: The Explore California Website

  - View File Edits: (real world edits, look like)

    - change 4 digits of a phone number in the explore_california project folder's HTML
      - in Atom, used Find > Find in project > and searched globally for the last 4 digits "4315" to be changed to 4314.
      - selected all of the instances of "4315" and changed all.
      - File > Save All, makes the changes officially changes in the folder.

    - Used BASH cmd: "git diff" to view all of the changes in a paginator.
      - <spacebar> will move forward through the pages as well as "f, forward" or "b, backward" are used to navigate the pages.
      - lines wrapping, cmd type "-S" (capital S) toggles between chopping and wrapping the lines.
      - "q" exits the paginator

    - additional "git diff" options cmd: "git diff --color-words" shows only the words that are different, instead of +- for the entire line. Helpful for long paragraphs.
