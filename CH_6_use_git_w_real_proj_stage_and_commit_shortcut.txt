  - Stage and Commit - Shortcut

    - Normal process for staging and committing changes to a repo is to:
      1. cmd "git add <file>" to Staging Index
      2. cmd: "git commit <file>" to the Repository

    - If you already know that you are ready to commit everything to the Repository and skip the Staging step, use:
      - cmd: "git commit -a <file>", same as cmd: "git commit --all" which commits all the files.
        - two important caveats:
          1. Stages and Commits all the changes to the tracked files. Everything!
          2. Does not include untracked files.

        - used cmd: "git commit -am "message"", to commit all files and deliver a commit message.
